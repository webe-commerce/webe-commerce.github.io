# 🏪 Branding Update - Your Own E-Commerce Store

## ✨ What Changed

Your website has been transformed from a **platform comparison site** into **your own branded e-commerce store** with affiliate products.

## 🎯 Key Changes

### 1. **Removed All Platform Text References**

**Before:**
- "แนะนำสินค้าดีจาก Shopee | Lazada | TikTok Shop"

### 2. **Platform Badges Remain on Product Images Only**

✅ **What's Kept:**
- Small badge icons on bottom-left of product images
- Shopee icon (orange)
- Lazada icon (blue)
- TikTok icon (black/gradient)
- Shows on hover with platform name

✅ **Purpose:**
- Transparency (customers know where they're buying)
- Not intrusive (small and subtle)
- Professional appearance

### 3. **Removed Platform-Specific Navigation**

❌ **Removed:**
- Hero platform quick access buttons
- Sticky floating vendor buttons
- "Choose your platform" sections
- Platform filter buttons

✅ **Why:**

### 4. **Enhanced Generic Branding**

**Updated:**
- Page title: "WeBeCommerce - ช้อปออนไลน์ สินค้าคุณภาพ ราคาดี"
- Description: "ร้านค้าออนไลน์ แนะนำสินค้าคุณภาพ"
- All structured data shows "WeBeCommerce" as seller
- Focus on quality and value, not platforms
